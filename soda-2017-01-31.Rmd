# Oh give me an -ome...

## Outline

- We've got problems...right here in River City
- Thinking big, REALLY BIG, about how to solve them

# Problems facing social and behavioral science

## Reproducibility

## What does reproducibility mean?

- Goodman

## Rich man, poor man

- Lots of data
- Can't get to it
- Vertically siloed
- Commercially controlled

## Underpowered

## What's at stake?

- Long history of science denialism/marginalization
    + Consequences of disbelief
- Science denialism largely sociocultural
- Problems we face require scientific solutions
    + technical
    + social/political/economic
    + behavioral

# Smaller-scale solutions

## Munafo et al. 2017 manifesto

## Transparency and Openness Promotion Guidelines

## Better training

## Literate Programming

- RStudio
- Jupyter notebooks
- Wide open science

## Data and materials sharing

- Open Science Framework
- Databrary

## Databrary.org

## Video essential for reproducibility

## Changing journal, institutional practices

# REALLY BIG solutions

<!-- 
## Big science in other fields

- Hubble Space Telescope
- Human Genome Project
- Human Connectome Project
- Personalized medicine/eHealth

<div class="notes">
The Hubble Ultra Deep Field. Taken over 3.5 months in 2003-04. Contains an estimated 10,000 galaxies, and because time and space collapse at astronomical distances, looks back ~13 billion years, or 400-800 years before the big bang.

## What's big social and behavioral science look like?

- See Gilmore 2015 about Developmental Science.
- U.S. Census
- Panel Study on Income Dynamics (PSID)
- AdHealth
- ECLS-B
- But, National Children's Study (also in U.K.)

## Data hypercube

## Data collection

## Data harmonization and preparation

- Essential data linkages
    + People
    + Locations
    + Dates and times
    
## Data storage and sharing

## Respecting privacy

- Give participants meaningful ownership over their data
- Give participants value for contributing

## Analysis and Inquiry

## Reporting and Publication
